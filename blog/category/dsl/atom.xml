    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First, let's create a empty java project in eclipse IDE, download newest playable dropincc.java jar file from <a href="https://github.com/pfmiles/dropincc.java/downloads">here</a>. Adding it to the build path of the project, like this(note: jdk1.6 or above required):<br/>
<img src="/images/dropincc/calc/emptyProjWithJar.png" alt="emptyProjWithJar" /><br/>
And then, create a new java source file to build our grammar, for example, <code>Calculator.java</code>.<br/>
We start by specifying the EBNF form of our expected calculator language. The calculator expression would do addition and subtraction operations and also multiplication and division operations which have a greater priority.<br/>
Also, we expect the calculator could handle parentheses to do priority adjustment.<br/>
We could write the EBNF grammar rules in a top-down pattern:</p>

<pre><code>calc ::= expr $
expr ::= addend (('+'|'-') addend)*
</code></pre>

<p>We specified that the overall <code>expression</code> consists one or more <code>addend</code> sub-expressions with <code>'+'</code> or <code>'-'</code> symbol delimited.<br/>
And for every single <code>addend</code> expression:</p>

<pre><code>addend ::= factor (('\*'|'/') factor)*
</code></pre>

<p>consists one or more <code>factor</code> separated by <code>'*'</code> or <code>'/'</code>.<br/>
And finally, for any single <code>factor</code>, is either a single digit or a quoted expression:</p>

<pre><code>factor ::= '\d+(\.\d+)?'
         | '(' expr ')'
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, we've done defining the EBNF of our calculator. This is what it look like all over:</p>

<pre><code>calc ::= expr $
expr ::= addend (('+'|'-') addend)*
addend ::= factor (('\*'|'/') factor)*
factor ::= '\d+(\.\d+)?'
         | '(' expr ')'
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>It's quite short because it utilized the kleene notation to represent 'zero or more'. And a shorter EBNF ends up a shorter dropincc.java program!<br/>
Now let's 'translate' the EBNF into dropincc.java program. I say 'translate' here because it's a really straightforward step:</p>

<pre><code>// some elements' pre-definitions in order to call the methods
Lang calc = new Lang("Calc");
TokenDef a = calc.newToken("\\+");
TokenDef m = calc.newToken("\\*");
Grule expr = calc.newGrule();
Grule addend = calc.newGrule();
Grule factor = calc.newGrule();

// grammar definition section start
calc.defineGrule(expr, CC.EOF);
expr.define(addend, CC.ks(a.or("\\-"), addend));
addend.define(factor, CC.ks(m.or("/"), factor));
factor.define("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?")
.alt("\\(", expr, "\\)");
// grammar definition end
</code></pre>

<p>The 'grammar definition' part is as many lines as the EBNF. In fact it's a line-by-line translation of the EBNF(please look at the 'grammar definition' section carefully).</p>

<p>Just a little more explanation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The basic elements of grammar rule is <code>TokenDef</code>s and <code>Grule</code>s.(In fact <code>Grule</code> means 'grammar rule') <code>TokenDef</code>s are defined using java built-in regular expression currently.</li>
<li>Rule production's match sequence is represented as comma separated elements list. Like <code>expr, CC.EOF</code> means <code>expr $</code>, <code>addend, CC.ks(a.or("\\-"), addend)</code> means <code>addend (('+'|'-') addend)*</code>.</li>
<li>Note the <code>CC.EOF</code> constant, it's a predefined constant provided by dropincc.java to represent <code>EOF</code> token definition.</li>
<li>And the <code>CC.ks</code> method call means all elements passed in as parameters are enclosed in a kleene star node(kleene star node means zero or more multiplication of its enclosing elements, the same as you learnt from using a regular expression). And <code>ks</code> in fact means 'kleene star'.</li>
<li>Likewise, there are <code>CC.kc</code> method and <code>CC.op</code> method which means <code>kleene cross</code>(one or more) and <code>optional</code>(zero or one) respectively but not used in the above example, you can browse them from source code.</li>
<li>Rule alternative productions are represented by an <code>alt</code> method call. Look at the <code>factor</code> rule definition, the <code>factor</code> rule has two productions. And, respectively, in java code, it has an additional <code>alt</code> call besides <code>define</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>'Comma separated match sequence', 'CC.EOF', 'CC.ks/kc/op' and 'alt', those are almost all you need to know to define a non-trivial DSL grammar in dropincc.java.</p>

<p>Ok, after we have defined the grammar, it's time to add <code>Action</code>s to process the elements the parser matched while parsing. It's also achieved by a very intuitive way:</p>

<ul>
<li>One <code>alternative production</code>(note: not one rule) could have only one action. That's, the <code>calc</code> rule could have only one action because it has only one alternative production. While <code>factor</code> rule could have two actions because it has two alternative productions.</li>
<li>Let's add actions for the <code>factor</code> rule first:</li>
</ul>


<p>For the first alternative production:</p>

<pre><code>factor.define("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?").action(new Action&lt;String&gt;(){
    public Double act(String matched) {
        return Double.parseDouble(matched);
    }})
</code></pre>

<p>The first alt of <code>factor</code> rule only matches a single string which have a 'digit' format. So the <code>act</code> method of the <code>Action</code> interface should be a single <code>String</code> object holding the matched digit string. And, also, the generic type argument of <code>Action</code> interface should be <code>String</code>, to provide a strong type safety for the actually matched element.<br/>
We just parse the matched digit string to a number and returned it. So the return type of this action is <code>Double</code>.</p>

<p>And the <code>Action</code> for the second alt:</p>

<pre><code>.alt("\\(", expr, "\\)").action(new Action&lt;Object[]&gt;(){
    public Double act(Object[] ms) {
        return (Double) ms[1];
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The second alt is an expression enclosed by parentheses. There are three element in the match sequence: <code>(</code>, enclosing <code>expr</code>, and <code>)</code>.<br/>
The type argument of <code>Action</code> interface should be <code>Object[]</code> since the matched element will be passed in as an object array of length 3. With first element <code>(</code>, second element the returned value of the enclosing <code>expr</code> rule's action, and third element <code>)</code>.<br/>
All we care about is the second element: the returned value of the enclosing <code>expr</code>'s action. So we just return <code>ms[1]</code> here, ignoring <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>. Note that we confidently converted the <code>ms[1]</code> to a <code>Double</code> object, that's because we knew the return value of <code>expr</code> rule's action is definitely a <code>Double</code> value.</p>

<ul>
<li>Then, let's add action for the <code>addend</code> rule:</li>
</ul>


<p>It has only one production, so it could have only one corresponding action:</p>

<pre><code>addend.define(factor, CC.ks(m.or("/"), factor)).action(new Action&lt;Object[]&gt;() {
    public Double act(Object[] ms) {
        Double f0 = (Double) ms[0];
        Object[] others = (Object[]) ms[1];
        for (Object other : others) {
            Object[] opAndFactor = (Object[]) other;
            if ("*".equals(opAndFactor[0])) {
                f0 *= (Double) opAndFactor[1];
            } else {
                f0 /= (Double) opAndFactor[1];
            }
        }
        return f0;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The argument of <code>act</code> method is an object array of length 2. Its first element is the returned value from the matched <code>factor</code> rule's action,<br/>
and the second are other operator &amp; factor pairs.<br/>
If there's only one factor matched here, the 'operator &amp; factor' pairs would be an array of length 0, otherwise it contains all other matched operators and factors.<br/>
You can see that the argument structure of method <code>act</code> is highly consistent to the defined match sequence of the corresponding alternative production.</p>

<p>We wrote some logic to compute the total multiplication or division of all matched factors, and finally, returned the result as the result of this action.</p>

<ul>
<li>Then, we add action for the <code>expr</code> rule. It's almost the same as the action of <code>addend</code> rule, but in an <code>add</code> or <code>subtract</code> manner when computing the matched elements:</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>expr</code> rule also could have only one action:</p>

<pre><code>expr.define(addend, CC.ks(a.or("\\-"), addend)).action(new Action&lt;Object[]&gt;() {
    public Double act(Object[] ms) {
        Double a0 = (Double) ms[0];
        Object[] others = (Object[]) ms[1];
        for (Object other : others) {
            Object[] opAndFactor = (Object[]) other;
            if ("+".equals(opAndFactor[0])) {
                a0 += (Double) opAndFactor[1];
            } else {
                a0 -= (Double) opAndFactor[1];
            }
        }
        return a0;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we add action for the <code>calc</code> rule. It's the starter rule. All computations should have been done at this point. So all we need to do in its action is return the final result, ignoring the <code>EOF</code>:</p>

<pre><code>calc.defineGrule(expr, CC.EOF).action(new Action&lt;Object[]&gt;() {
    public Double act(Object[] ms) {
        return (Double) ms[0];
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we have done defining a calculator and added proper actions for it, we could <code>compile</code> it now:</p>

<pre><code>Exe exe = calc.compile();
</code></pre>

<p>Then, enjoy with our new calculator:</p>

<pre><code>// this should print the result: 3389.0
System.out.println(exe.eval("1 +2+3+(4 +5*6*7*(64/8/2/(2/1 )/1)*8  +9  )+   10"));
</code></pre>

<p>It's quite simple isn't it? If you are already familiar with the API, 15 min is too much for defining such a calculator!<br/>
And the follow is all the code in a gist, you could copy and try it in your own IDE:<br/>

    <updated>2012-08-10T00:40:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://pfmiles.github.com/blog/ideas-and-concepts-behind-dropincc-dot-java</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>DSLs in java is hard.</h3>

<p>DSLs are rarely discussed in java community. Or, at least comparing to other dynamic languages' world, DSLs in java is much harder to create.</p>

<p>Why does this happen?</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html">Martin Fowler's comments on DSLs</a>, they are separated mainly to two kinds: internal and external DSLs.</p>

<p>I believe that, the ability of how a specific general purposed programming language could be customized to an internal DSL relies on the language's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">meta-programming</a> features.</p>

<p>Some languages, especially dynamic typed ones, have ability to customize its syntactical appearance at runtime. By intercepting their class defining life-cycles, executing fail-over strategies when method or field missings, or doing presentation substitutions via sophisticated macro systems or even, directly change their parse tree at runtime. All those incredible features are the magic behind internal DSLs.</p>

<p>But, we sadly found that java has none of those magic stuff to help building internal DSLs. There's little meta-programming features in java. Annotations? Perhaps one rare creature, but its not enough.<br/>
Maybe the only way to create internal DSLs in java is to design a set of <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html">Fluent Interface</a> API. It's great, but you won't have much space on customizing the syntax of your DSL.</p>

<p>Then, seems that the possible ways to create real-world, sophisticated DSLs in java are always turns out to be external-DSLs. But, this won't be easy, always, since the creation of computer world.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Creating external DSLs means doing lexical &amp; syntactical analyzing all by ourselves. There is a whole bunch of open sourced tools, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler-compiler">parser generators</a>, to help doing so, but there's too much unnecessary efforts must be made before you get your grammar run.</p>

<p>Those traditional parser generators are great but in fact not suitable for DSL creating. Like lex&amp;bison, javacc, jcup and antlr etc. They usually have their own grammar you must learn to define grammar rules, this is some what big learning cost.<br/>
After you have done writing your grammar, they usually requires you to run a specific compiling tool in command-line to 'compile' the rules you just wrote. And finally gives you a couple of source files in your host language and telling you to place them into somewhere of your project directory. Then you could run your program. If errors occur, you would re-do those steps by frequently switching between command-line and your IDE.</p>

<p>These steps are troublesome in practice. Especially for those first using a parser generator. I've seen one of my colleague struggled against antlr for one month, in order to build a SQL-like DSL. And much of his time was spent on getting familiar with antlr's grammar, its 'antlrWorks' IDE and some command-line tools. It was painful when recall on this month.</p>

<p>So I think one must not have to carry so much burden when he just want to create a relatively simple DSL. And <a href="https://github.com/pfmiles/dropincc.java">dropincc.java</a> is something I create to ease the building process of external DSL in java.</p>

<h3>If all done in one place.</h3>

<ul>
<li>I don't think additional grammar must be created to describe grammar rules, this could be done in internal DSL in java, a.k.a fluent interfaces. Creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">EBNF</a> like internal DSL in java is affordable.</li>
<li>I don't think additional command-line tools or individual specific IDE is needed since we are adopting internal DSL to describe grammar rules. Just a commonly used java IDE is sufficient.</li>
<li>Also, I don't think we must repeat the compile-copy, and run cycle when we trying and debugging our new creating language. Grammar may be run directly just after we defined it. Like we edit and test java program instantly in most modern IDEs.</li>
</ul>


<p>And, all in all, in summary... dropincc.java ends up such a tool with those missions. I hope this small lib could help a lot in building external DSLs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Initial version released.</h3>

<p>Dropincc.java is a dynamic parser generator which allows you crafting your DSLs in pure java, using your favorite editor.<br/>
Now it reached its initial release version 0.1.0. You can download it from the <a href="https://github.com/pfmiles/dropincc.java">project page</a> and play around with it.<br/>
There's a detailed <em>Quick Start</em> guide on the project page, it could guide you through to have a overall feeling on using dropincc.java.</p>

<h3>Main attributes of Dropincc.java.</h3>

<ul>
<li>It's not just 'yet another compiler compiler'. It aims to help you building DSLs in java <strong>Dynamically</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> means you can use your newly defined DSL immediately after you have just finished its definition. No other steps required, no additional command-line instructions needed to type.</li>
<li>Very close to EBNF grammar syntactically when defining grammar rules using dropincc.java. With the fluent interface API, you can feel as if you are writing EBNF directly. Syntactically  close to EBNF is very nice for a parser generator.</li>
<li>It generates LL(*) parser for your language, dynamically, using java 1.6's compiler API. And it provide powerful <em>semantic predicate</em> mechanics to handle even context-sensitive situations.</li>
<li>It won't generate a parser source file to you and telling you to place the file into some where of your project directory. Instead, it handles all those generation &amp; compiling staff in the background and only provides you a executable object which you can invoke.</li>
<li>No other dependencies except for the built-in java library. Requires JDK 1.6 or above.</li>
</ul>


<h3>A dummy language example.</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>Requires JDK 1.6 or above. Firstly, place the dropincc <a href="https://github.com/downloads/pfmiles/dropincc.java/dropincc.java-0.1.0.jar">jar file</a> in your class path.</p>

<p>And then, crafting your language's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">EBNF</a> definition:<br/>
Let's define a language which accepts arbitrary numbers of quoted 'a' or 'bc'. For example: '(a)(bc)', '(bc)((a))' or '(((bc)))(bc)', the numbers of pairs of parentheses is unlimited.<br/>
The EBNF of this dummy language:</p>

<pre><code>S ::= L $
L ::= Q*
Q ::= 'a'
    | 'bc'
    | '(' Q ')'
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, after defining the EBNF representation of our language, it's time to <strong>translate</strong> the EBNF into dropincc.java representation. I say 'translate' here because this is a line-by-line straightforward step:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String... args) throws Throwable {
    Lang lang = new Lang("Dummy");
    TokenDef a = lang.newToken("a");
    TokenDef bc =lang.newToken("bc");
    TokenDef lp = lang.newToken("\\(");
    TokenDef rp = lang.newToken("\\)");
    Grule L = lang.newGrule();
    Grule Q = lang.newGrule();

    lang.defineGrule(L, CC.EOF); // S ::= L $
    L.define(CC.ks(Q));// L ::= Q*
    /*
     * Q ::= 'a'
     *     | 'bc'
     *     | '(' Q ')'
     */
    Q.define(a)
    .alt(bc)
    .alt(lp, Q, rp);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, we have done defining the grammar rules of our dummy language, so easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Define tokens, using built-in java regular expression syntax. And define rules, say, 'Grule's in dropincc.java. TokenDefs and Grules are basic elements of defining grammar rules.</li>
<li>You just using your defined TokenDefs and Grules to express your grammar, just like writing EBNF.</li>
<li>Elements concatenations are expressed by comma separated sequences: <code>L, CC.EOF</code> means <code>L $</code>. CC.EOF is a predefined TokenDef provided by dropincc.java.</li>
<li>Alternative productions of a grammar rule is expressed by a <code>alt</code> method call on a grule element. For example, the <code>Q</code> rule has three alternative productions.</li>
<li>The kleene star(means <strong>zero or more</strong>) and kleene cross(<strong>means one or more</strong>) notation is expressed by <code>CC.ks</code> and <code>CC.kc</code> utility functions. See the line: <code>L.define(CC.ks(Q));// L ::= Q*</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>That's almost all you need to learn about how to define a grammar using dropincc.java.<br/>
After that, you can <code>compile</code> your grammar:</p>

<pre><code>Exe exe = lang.compile();
</code></pre>

<p>This step would make you a callable object named 'exe'. You can use this object to <code>eval</code> and test your newly defined language:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(exe.eval("a(a)((bc))"));
</code></pre>

<p>This would print the output: <code>[Ljava.lang.Object;@67a5a19</code>. It's an object array which holds the whole parse tree:<br/>
<img src="/images/dropincc/dummy.png" alt="Dummy lang parse tree" /></p>

<p>But it's useless just getting the parse tree. We should do something to manipulate the parse tree and produce some 'results' of this parsing.</p>

<p>Ok, suppose we have a dummy task: to remove all parentheses from the input string, leaving only the <code>'a'</code> and <code>'bc'</code>s there. Then at last, return the resulting string as the return value of <code>eval</code> method call on <code>exe</code>.</p>

<p>This involves adding <code>actions</code> to the grammar. The <code>action</code>s are some kind of code block, it should execute when its' corresponding grammar rule production matches.</p>

<p>In dropincc.java, <code>actions</code> are implemented by <code>closure</code>s, using the <code>Action</code> interface. We try to add an action to the <code>Q</code> rule:</p>

<pre><code>Q.define(a).action(new Action() {
    public String act(Object matched) {
        return (String) matched;// string 'a'
    }
}).alt(bc).action(new Action() {
    public String act(Object matched) {
        return (String) matched;// string 'bc'
    }

}).alt(lp, Q, rp).action(new Action() {
    public String act(Object matched) {
        // returns the middle element matched, that's the returned value of the enclosing 'Q' rule
        return (String) ((Object[]) matched)[1];
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Above is the <code>Q</code> rule with three actions, each action for one alternative production. In fact since the first two actions does noting but just returning the matched string, so they are not necessary. The <code>Q</code> rule with action could be defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Q.define(a)
.alt(bc)
.alt(lp, Q, rp).action(new Action() {
    public String act(Object matched) {
        // returns the middle element matched, that's the returned value of the enclosing 'Q' rule
        return (String) ((Object[]) matched)[1];
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Leaving only the third action there. The third action, returned the middle element matched of its production(ignored left and right parentheses). The middle element matched is the return value of the recursively enclosing <code>Q</code> rule.</p>

<p>The action for <code>L</code> rule is quite simple and significant: it collects all strings matched and concatenates them into a whole large string, then return the resulting string:</p>

<pre><code>L.define(CC.ks(Q)).action(new Action() {
    public String act(Object matched) {
        Object[] ms = (Object[]) matched;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (Object m : ms)
            sb.append(m);
        return sb.toString();
    }
});// L ::= Q*
</code></pre>

<p>Then the last top-level rule's action: just return the value of <code>L</code> rule, just ignoring EOF:</p>

<pre><code>lang.defineGrule(L, CC.EOF).action(new Action() {
    public String act(Object matched) {
        return (String) ((Object[]) matched)[0];
    }
}); // S ::= L $
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, we can now run the program again and could see it prints out the output: <code>aabc</code>, with all parentheses removed.</p>

<p>The whole program in a gist:<br/>

You can download and play around with it on your own.</p>

<p>Dropincc.java is currently on its very initial stage. It has some major improvements to be done:</p>

<ul>
<li>It uses java's built-in regEx implementation to support token definition, so it couldn't do 'longest match' currently. This should be fixed later.</li>
<li>Due to some LL(*) analysis issues, 'Non-LL regular' exceptions may be thrown when it encounters some special case of grammar rules. This must be fixed soon.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a more practical <strong>Hello World</strong> example which implements a full-featured calculator in the quick start guide of dropincc.java. On its project <a href="https://github.com/pfmiles/dropincc.java">home page</a>. Go and check out there if you like.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="http://dropincc-java.1068093.n5.nabble.com/">forum</a> for dropincc.java, interested people could discuss about it in the forum. And you are welcomed to subscribe to the mailing list(there's a how to guide in the forum about subscribe to the mailing list).</p>
